modules needed fastecdsa, binascii, Point<p>
tested with python39<p>
output to increased.txt<p>
Example python39 keyspace_up.py<p>
Enter the public key in hexadecimal format: 03a7a4c30291ac1db24b4ab00c442aa832f7794b5a0959bec6e8d7fee802289dcd   (keyspace 10)<p>

HIT!! Private Key: 2020<p>  
pubkey: 037dbbd8083d60c9349551a3f42ef560c3807fe2bf51d7fd69dfce62549a5f1277<p>
to get back to the original private key you divide 2020 Hex by 4 power of 2 <p>
2020 hex = 8224 decimal and 4 power 2 = 16<p>  8224/16= 514 or 202 hex <p>
